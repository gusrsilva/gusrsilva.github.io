<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>
  In this project we put the skills we have learned in CS184 to use. We first develop a simple
  particle renderer with controls. We then attempt to used a particle-based approach to simulate water.
  The key to simulating any fluid is enforcing incompressibility. Unfortunately, this is
  computationally expensive. In the paper
  <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Position Based Fluids</a>,
  Muller and Macklin describe a method for simulating fluids in a relatively efficient
  manner while not requiring impractical timesteps. We attempt to implement the
  various ideas in this paper such as enforcing incompressibility by incorporating
  density constraints into Position Based Dynamics, simulating surface tension by adding
  artificial pressure, and reducing damping by adding vorticity confinement and viscosity.

<h2 align="middle"> Technical Approach</h2>
<p>
  A 1-2 page summary of your technical approach, techniques used, algorithms
  implemented, etc. (use references to papers or other resources for further detail).
  Highlight how your approach varied from the references used (did you implement a
  subset, or did you change or enhance anything), the unique decisions you made
  and why.
</p>
<p>
  A description of problems encountered and how you tackled them.
</p>
<p>
  A description of lessons learned.
</p>

<h2 align="middle"> Results</h2>
<p>
  Your final images, animations, video of your system (whichever is relevant).
  You can include results that you think show off what you built but that you
  did not have time to go over on presentation day.
</p>

<h2 align="middle"> Contributions</h2>
<p>
  A clear description of the work contributed by each team member
