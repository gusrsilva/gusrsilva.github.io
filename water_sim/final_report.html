  A paragraph summary of the entire project.
</b></font>
<p>
  In this project we put the skills we have learned in CS184 to use. We first develop a simple
  particle renderer with controls. We then attempt to used a particle-based approach to simulate water.
  The key to simulating any fluid is enforcing incompressibility. Unfortunately, this is
  computationally expensive. In the paper
  <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Position Based Fluids</a>,
  Muller and Macklin describe a method for simulating fluids in a relatively efficient
  manner while not requiring impractical timesteps. We attempt to implement the
  various ideas in this paper such as enforcing incompressibility by incorporating
  density constraints into Position Based Dynamics, simulating surface tension by adding
  artificial pressure, and reducing damping by adding vorticity confinement and viscosity.

<h3>Particle Renderer</h3>
<p>
  Before we could simulate anything, we needed something to view our results on. We
  followed the excellent tutorials on <a href="opengl-tutorial.org">opengl-tutorial.org</a>
  and learned how to use openGL to create a window and render objects. We then tailored
  this to our need in order to render our particles that would eventually simulate
  water.

</div>


<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>
  We now wanted a way to navigate our space. Thankfully, the
  <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__input.html">GLFW Library</a> provides
  plenty of functions to get user input. We decided to go with FPS like controls and so
  the arrow keys allow the camera to strafe in the respective direction and moving the
  mouse affects the direction in which the camera is pointed. We now have a convenient
  way of viewing our particles from any point of view that we like.

<h3>Water Simulation</h3>
<p>
  Now that we have a basic particle renderer and a way to navigate, let's add some
  action to our particles!
</p>
<h4>Pseudocode</h4>
<p>
  As previously mentioned, we follow the technique described by Macklin and Muller in
  the Position Based Fluids Paper (linked above). From a high level, the algorithm
  is as follows:
